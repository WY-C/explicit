Suppose you are an assistant who is proficient in the overcooked_ai game. Your goal is to control Player 1 and cooperate with Player 0 who is real person.
- Player 0 and Player 1 cannot communicate. 
- For each step, you will receive the current scene (including the kitchen, teammates status, partner's 3 step position history).
- Based on the current scene, you need to 
    1. Describe the current scene and analysis it,
    2. Infer what Player 0 will do, 
    3. Plan ONLY ONE best skill for Player 1 to do right now based on infered player 0's intention. Format should not use natural language, but use the allowed functions.

Instructions:
- The Overcooked_AI game requires two players to work together as a team with the goal of achieving the highest possible score.
- Map Constraint: The kitchen is strictly divided into two separate zones (Left and Right) by a central counter/pot barrier. Players CANNOT walk from one side to the other. They are physically isolated and can only interact by placing items on the shared counters or using the shared pots in the middle.
- To get the points, the team need to make soup according to recipe, fill the soup in a dish and immediately deliver the soup to the service loc. Once a delivery is made, the team gets 20 points. Plus, this soup and dishes will disappear, no need to wash and recycle the dishes.
- To make a soup, the team must pick up **three onions** one by one, put them in a pot. The pot will automatically start cooking when the pot is full (contains 3 onions) and it will take 20 time steps to complete the soup.
- Items (onions and dishes) can be obtained from dispensers, which have an unlimited supply. However, each player can only pick up and hold one item at a time.
- The pot is a stationary unit that cannot be moved, and can ONLY hold three onions.
- After start cooking, the pot needs certain cooking timesteps to finish a food. Before the food is finished, players can choose to:
    - Pick up the dish and wait.
    - Prepare for another cook cycle (especially if there is more than one pot in the environment).
- Once a onions is picked up, it can only be held by the player, placed in the pot (unless the pot is full), or placed on a counter. Similarly, once a dish is picked up, it can either be held by the player, filled with soup, or placed on a counter.
- One counter can place Only one item.
- Inventory Constraint: If a player holds an item (onion or dish), they CANNOT pickup another item. They MUST put_onion_in_pot, fill_dish_with_soup, or place_obj_on_counter first.

Skill: 
In this game, each player can ONLY perform the following 6 allowed skill: pickup_onion, pickup_dish, put_onion_in_pot, fill_dish_with_soup, deliver_soup, place_obj_on_counter, wait. Do not attempt to use any other skills that are not listed here.
- pickup_onion(dispenser_id): Pick up an onion from a specific dispenser. Requirement: Hand is empty.
- pickup_dish(dispenser_id): Pick up a dish. Requirement: Hand is empty.
- put_onion_in_pot(pot_id): Put the held onion into a pot. Requirement: Holding onion, Pot is not full.
- fill_dish_with_soup(pot_id): Fill the held dish with soup. Requirement: Holding dish, Soup is ready.
- deliver_soup(serving_id): Deliver soup. Requirement: Holding soup.
- place_obj_on_counter(): Place the held item on a specific counter. Requirement: Hand is not empty.

A: Analysis: <Pot 0> needs 1 more onion to start cooking. <Player 1> is near <Onion Dispenser 0> and is in the best position to get the last onion. <Player 0> is near <Dish Dispenser 1> and should prepare a dish since the soup will be ready soon.

A: Analysis: <Pot 0> has one onion and needs two more. Both players are holding onions. <Player 1> should move to the pot to add the onion. <Player 0> is already close to <Pot 0> and will likely put their onion in as well.

A: Analysis: <Pot 0> has soup ready. <Player 1> (Me) holds an onion but cannot use it in <Pot 0> because it is full/ready. <Player 0> holds a dish. <Player 0> must fill the dish with soup to empty <Pot 0>.

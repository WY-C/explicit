Suppose you are an assistant who is proficient in the overcooked_ai game. Your goal is to control Player 1 and cooperate with Player 0 who is real person.
- For each step, you will receive the current scene information.
- Based on the information, you need to
	1. Describe the current scene and analysis it,
	2. Infer what Player 0 will do,
	3. Plan ONLY ONE best skill for Player 1 to do right now based on infered player 0's intention. Format should not use natural language, but use the allowed functions.

Instructions:
- The Overcooked_AI game requires two players to work together as a team with the goal of achieving the highest possible score.
- To get the points, the team need to make soup according to recipe, fill the soup in a dish and immediately deliver the soup to the service loc. Once a delivery is made, the team gets 20 points. Plus, this soup and dishes will disappear, no need to wash and recycle the dishes.
- To make a soup, the team must pick up three onions one by one, put them in a pot. The pot will automatically start cooking when the pot is full (contains 3 onions) and it will take 20 time steps to complete the soup.
- Items (onions and dishes) can be obtained from dispensers, which have an unlimited supply. However, each player can only pick up and hold one item at a time.
- The pot is a stationary unit that cannot be moved, and can ONLY hold three onions.
- After start cooking, the pot needs certain cooking timesteps to finish a food. Before the food is finished, players can choose to:
	- Pick up the dish and wait.
	- Prepare for another cook cycle (especially if there is more than one pot in the environment).
- Once a onions is picked up, it can only be held by the player, placed in the pot (unless the pot is full), or placed on a counter. Similarly, once a dish is picked up, it can either be held by the player, filled with soup, or placed on a counter.
- One counter can place Only one item.
- Inventory Constraint: If a player holds an item (onion or dish), they CANNOT pickup another item. They MUST put_onion_in_pot, fill_dish_with_soup, or place_obj_on_counter first.
- Layout Notation: <Object> [P0:X, P1:Y] indicates the shortest path distance from the object to Player 0 is X steps, and to Player 1 is Y steps. A SMALLER number means the player is CLOSER to the object.

Skill:
In this game, each player can ONLY perform the following 6 allowed skill:pickup_onion, pickup_dish, put_onion_in_pot, fill_dish_with_soup, deliver_soup, place_obj_on_counter, wait. Do not attempt to use any other skills that are not listed here.
- pickup_onion(dispenser_id): Pick up an onion from a specific dispenser. Requirement: Hand is empty.
- pickup_dish(dispenser_id): Pick up a dish. Requirement: Hand is empty.
- put_onion_in_pot(pot_id): Put the held onion into a pot. Requirement: Holding onion, Pot is not full.
- fill_dish_with_soup(pot_id): Fill the held dish with soup. Requirement: Holding dish, Soup is ready.
- deliver_soup(serving_id): Deliver soup. Requirement: Holding soup.
- place_obj_on_counter(): Place the held item on a specific counter. Requirement: Hand is not empty

Here are few examples:
<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:6, P1:1], <OnionD 1> [P0:1, P1:6]; <DishD 0> [P0:5, P1:2]; <Pot 0> [P0:2, P1:2]; <Serve 0> [P0:6, P1:3]; Scene 0: <Player 0> holds nothing at (5, 2). <Player 1> holds nothing at (1, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: Start -> (1, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> is empty.
Analysis: Pot 0 is empty and requires ingredients. Both players are currently holding nothing. To maximize efficiency, I (Player 1) should move to my nearest onion dispenser (OnionD 0), while Player 0 should head to OnionD 1 to start the cooking process.
Intention for Player 0: "pickup_onion(1)"
Plan for Player 1: "pickup_onion(0)"
</example>

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:1, P1:5]; <DishD 0> [P0:5, P1:2]; <Pot 0> [P0:1, P1:4]; <Serve 0> [P0:6, P1:3]; Scene 60: <Player 0> holds one onion at (1, 2). <Player 1> holds nothing at (3, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: (4, 2) -> (3, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> starts cooking, ready in 15 steps.
Analysis: Pot 0 is currently cooking and cannot accept more ingredients. Player 0 is holding an onion, which blocks them from performing other tasks. I (Player 1) should move to fetch a dish, while Player 0 should place their onion on a counter to free their hands.
Intention for Player 0: "wait()"
Plan for Player 1: "pickup_dish(0)"
</example>

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:6, P1:1], <OnionD 1> [P0:1, P1:6]; <DishD 0> [P0:5, P1:2]; <Pot 0> [P0:2, P1:2]; <Serve 0> [P0:6, P1:3]; Scene 12: <Player 0> holds nothing at (3, 2). <Player 1> holds one onion at (2, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: (1, 2) -> (2, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has 1 onion.
Analysis: Pot 0 needs more ingredients. I (Player 1) am holding an onion and am close to the pot, so I will deposit it. Player 0 is empty-handed and should fetch the next onion from OnionD 1 to maintain the supply chain.

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:6, P1:2]; <DishD 0> [P0:1, P1:5]; <Pot 0> [P0:2, P1:2]; <Serve 0> [P0:6, P1:3]; Scene 55: <Player 0> holds nothing at (2, 2). <Player 1> holds nothing at (4, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: (4, 1) -> (4, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> starts cooking, ready in 2 steps.
Analysis: Pot 0 is about to finish cooking. We need a dish immediately to serve. Since Player 0 is 1 step away from DishD 0 (closer than my 5 steps), they should pick up the dish. I (Player 1) will head to the onion dispenser to prepare for the next batch.

Analysis: The soup was just delivered and Pot 0 is empty. We need to restart the cycle. Player 0 is holding an unnecessary dish that prevents them from picking up onions. While Player 0 clears their hand by placing the dish on a counter, I (Player 1) will start fetching onions.

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:1, P1:5]; <DishD 0> [P0:5, P1:2]; <Pot 0> [P0:2, P1:3]; <Serve 0> [P0:6, P1:3]; Scene 95: <Player 0> holds one dish at (2, 2). <Player 1> holds one onion at (3, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: (4, 2) -> (3, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has already cooked the soup.
Analysis: The soup is ready. Player 0 is already holding a dish and is next to the pot, so they will plate the soup. I (Player 1) have the onion for the next batch, but I must wait for Player 0 to empty the pot first.
Intention for Player 0: "fill_dish_with_soup(0)"

Analysis: Pot 0 needs exactly one more onion. I (Player 1) am positioned right next to OnionD 0 and will pick up the final onion. Since the pot will be busy cooking soon, Player 0 should move toward DishD 0 to prepare for serving.

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:1, P1:5]; <DishD 0> [P0:6, P1:1]; <Pot 0> [P0:3, P1:4]; <Serve 0> [P0:5, P1:3]; Scene 24: <Player 0> holds nothing at (1, 2). <Player 1> holds nothing at (5, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: (4, 2) -> (5, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has 2 onions.
Analysis: Pot 0 currently has 2 onions and needs exactly one more to begin cooking. Player 0 is empty-handed and positioned right next to the onion dispenser (distance 1) so they will naturally pick up the final onion. Since the cooking process will start shortly and I (Player 1) am right next to the dish dispenser (DishD 0), I should prepare for the serving phase by grabbing a dish.

Analysis: The soup in Pot 0 is fully cooked and ready to be served. I (Player 1) am already holding a dish and am adjacent to the pot, so my immediate next action is to plate the soup. Player 0 is holding an onion for the next cooking cycle but must wait until I empty the pot before they can deposit their ingredient.

Suppose you are an assistant who is proficient in the overcooked_ai game. Your goal is to control Player 1 and cooperate with Player 0 who is real person.
- For each step, you will receive the current scene information.
- Based on the information, you need to
	1. Describe the current scene and analysis it,
	2. Infer what Player 0 will do,
	3. Plan ONLY ONE best skill for Player 1 to do right now based on infered player 0's intention. Format should not use natural language, but use the allowed functions.

Instructions:
- The Overcooked_AI game requires two players to work together as a team with the goal of achieving the highest possible score.
- To get the points, the team need to make soup according to recipe, fill the soup in a dish and immediately deliver the soup to the service loc. Once a delivery is made, the team gets 20 points. Plus, this soup and dishes will disappear, no need to wash and recycle the dishes.
- To make a soup, the team must pick up three onions one by one, put them in a pot. The pot will automatically start cooking when the pot is full (contains 3 onions) and it will take 20 time steps to complete the soup.
- Items (onions and dishes) can be obtained from dispensers, which have an unlimited supply. However, each player can only pick up and hold one item at a time.
- The pot is a stationary unit that cannot be moved, and can ONLY hold three onions.
- After start cooking, the pot needs certain cooking timesteps to finish a food. Before the food is finished, players can choose to:
	- Pick up the dish and wait.
	- Prepare for another cook cycle (especially if there is more than one pot in the environment).
- Once a onions is picked up, it can only be held by the player, placed in the pot (unless the pot is full), or placed on a counter. Similarly, once a dish is picked up, it can either be held by the player, filled with soup, or placed on a counter.
- One counter can place Only one item.
- Inventory Constraint: If a player holds an item (onion or dish), they CANNOT pickup another item. They MUST put_onion_in_pot, fill_dish_with_soup, or place_obj_on_counter first.
- Layout Notation: <Object> [P0:X, P1:Y] indicates the shortest path distance from the object to Player 0 is X steps, and to Player 1 is Y steps. A SMALLER number means the player is CLOSER to the object.

Skill:
In this game, each player can ONLY perform the following 6 allowed skill:pickup_onion, pickup_dish, put_onion_in_pot, fill_dish_with_soup, deliver_soup, place_obj_on_counter, wait. Do not attempt to use any other skills that are not listed here.
- pickup_onion(dispenser_id): Pick up an onion from a specific dispenser. Requirement: Hand is empty.
- pickup_dish(dispenser_id): Pick up a dish. Requirement: Hand is empty.
- put_onion_in_pot(pot_id): Put the held onion into a pot. Requirement: Holding onion, Pot is not full.
- fill_dish_with_soup(pot_id): Fill the held dish with soup. Requirement: Holding dish, Soup is ready.
- deliver_soup(serving_id): Deliver soup. Requirement: Holding soup.
- place_obj_on_counter(): Place the held item on a specific counter. Requirement: Hand is not empty

Here are few examples:
<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:6, P1:1], <OnionD 1> [P0:1, P1:6]; <DishD 0> [P0:5, P1:2]; <Pot 0> [P0:2, P1:2]; <Serve 0> [P0:6, P1:3]; Scene 0: <Player 1> holds nothing at (5, 2). <Player 0> holds nothing at (1, 2). <Player 0> History: Moved: Start -> (1, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> is empty.
Analysis: A pot is empty and require ingredients. Both players are currently holding nothing. To maximize efficiency, each player should move to their nearest onion dispenser to begin the cooking process.
Intention for Player 0: "pickup_onion(1)"
Plan for Player 1: "pickup_onion(0)"
</example>

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:1, P1:5]; <DishD 0> [P0:5, P1:2]; <Pot 0> [P0:1, P1:4]; <Serve 0> [P0:6, P1:3]; Scene 60: <Player 0> holds one onion at (1, 2). <Player 1> holds nothing at (3, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: (4, 2) -> (3, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> starts cooking, ready in 15 steps.
Analysis: Pot 0 is currently cooking and cannot accept more ingredients. Player 0 is holding an onion, which blocks them from performing other tasks like fetching a dish. To be efficient, Player 0 should place the onion on a nearby counter to free their hand, while Player 1 moves to get a dish. 
Intention for Player 1: "pickup_dish(0)"
Plan for Player 0: "place_obj_on_counter()"
</example>

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:6, P1:1], <OnionD 1> [P0:1, P1:6]; <DishD 0> [P0:5, P1:2]; <Pot 0> [P0:2, P1:2]; <Serve 0> [P0:6, P1:3]; Scene 12: <Player 0> holds nothing at (3, 2). <Player 1> holds one onion at (2, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: (1, 2) -> (2, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has 1 onion.
Analysis: Pot 0 needs more ingredients. Player 1 holds an onion and is close to Pot 0, so they will deposit it. Player 0 is empty-handed and should fetch the next onion from their nearest dispenser (OnionD 1) to maintain the supply chain.
Intention for Player 1: "put_onion_in_pot(0)"
Plan for Player 0: "pickup_onion(1)"
</example>

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:6, P1:2]; <DishD 0> [P0:1, P1:5]; <Pot 0> [P0:2, P1:2]; <Serve 0> [P0:6, P1:3]; Scene 55: <Player 0> holds nothing at (2, 2). <Player 1> holds nothing at (4, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: (4, 1) -> (4, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> starts cooking, ready in 2 steps.
Analysis: Pot 0 is about to finish cooking (2 steps remaining). We need a dish immediately to serve the soup. Player 0 is closest to DishD 0. Player 1 is far from dishes. Player 0 should pick up a dish to be ready to serve.
Intention for Player 1: "pickup_onion(0)"
Plan for Player 0: "pickup_dish(0)"
</example>

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:2, P1:2]; <DishD 0> [P0:1, P1:5]; <Pot 0> [P0:2, P1:2]; <Serve 0> [P0:3, P1:3]; Scene 78: <Player 0> holds one dish at (2, 2). <Player 1> holds nothing at (3, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: (3, 3) -> (3, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> is empty.
Analysis: The soup has just been delivered, and Pot 0 is now empty. We need to restart the cooking cycle by adding onions. Player 0 is holding a dish, which is currently unnecessary and prevents picking up onions. Player 0 must discard the dish on a counter to free their hand and help gather ingredients. Player 1 is free to start fetching onions.
Intention for Player 1: "pickup_onion(0)"
Plan for Player 0: "place_obj_on_counter()"
</example>

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:1, P1:5]; <DishD 0> [P0:5, P1:2]; <Pot 0> [P0:2, P1:3]; <Serve 0> [P0:6, P1:3]; Scene 95: <Player 0> holds one dish at (2, 2). <Player 1> holds one onion at (3, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: (4, 2) -> (3, 2). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has already cooked the soup.
Analysis: The soup in Pot 0 is fully cooked and ready to be served. Player 0 is holding a dish and is adjacent to the pot, so the immediate next step is to plate the soup. Player 1 is holding an onion for the next batch but must wait for Player 0 to empty the pot.
Intention for Player 1: "wait()"
Plan for Player 0: "fill_dish_with_soup(0)"
</example>

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:6, P1:1]; <DishD 0> [P0:2, P1:5]; <Pot 0> [P0:3, P1:3]; <Serve 0> [P0:6, P1:3]; Scene 42: <Player 0> holds nothing at (2, 2). <Player 1> holds nothing at (1, 1). <Player 1> History: Moved: (1, 2) -> (1, 1). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has 2 onions.
Analysis: Pot 0 needs exactly one more onion. Player 1 is positioned right next to OnionD 0 (dist 1) and is empty-handed, so they will undoubtedly pick up the final onion to start the cooking process. Since the pot will be busy cooking shortly, Player 0 should not get an onion but instead move to DishD 0 to prepare a dish for serving.

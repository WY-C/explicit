Suppose you are an assistant who is proficient in the overcooked_ai game. Your goal is to control Player 1 and cooperate with Player 0 who is real person.
- For each step, you will receive the current scene information.
- Based on the information, you need to
	1. Describe the current scene and analysis it,
	2. Infer what Player 0 will do,
	3. Plan ONLY ONE best skill for Player 1 to do right now based on infered player 0's intention. Format should not use natural language, but use the allowed functions.

Instructions:
- The Overcooked_AI game requires two players to work together as a team with the goal of achieving the highest possible score.
- To get the points, the team need to make soup according to recipe, fill the soup in a dish and immediately deliver the soup to the service loc. Once a delivery is made, the team gets 20 points. Plus, this soup and dishes will disappear, no need to wash and recycle the dishes.
- To make a soup, the team must pick up three onions one by one, put them in a pot. The pot will automatically start cooking when the pot is full (contains 3 onions) and it will take 20 time steps to complete the soup.
- Items (onions and dishes) can be obtained from dispensers, which have an unlimited supply. However, each player can only pick up and hold one item at a time.
- The pot is a stationary unit that cannot be moved, and can ONLY hold three onions.
- After start cooking, the pot needs certain cooking timesteps to finish a food. Before the food is finished, players can choose to:
	- Pick up the dish and wait.
	- Prepare for another cook cycle (especially if there is more than one pot in the environment).
- Once a onions is picked up, it can only be held by the player, placed in the pot (unless the pot is full), or placed on a counter. Similarly, once a dish is picked up, it can either be held by the player, filled with soup, or placed on a counter.
- One counter can place Only one item.
- Inventory Constraint: If a player holds an item (onion or dish), they CANNOT pickup another item. They MUST put_onion_in_pot, fill_dish_with_soup, or place_obj_on_counter first.
- Map Topology Constraint: The center of the kitchen is blocked, creating narrow pathways. Players cannot pass through each other. If the other player is carrying an important item (like soup) and is moving through a narrow path, you MUST prioritize using the wait skill to yield the way and avoid deadlocks.

Skill:
In this game, each player can ONLY perform the following 6 allowed skill:pickup_onion, pickup_dish, put_onion_in_pot, fill_dish_with_soup, deliver_soup, place_obj_on_counter, wait. Do not attempt to use any other skills that are not listed here.
- pickup_onion(dispenser_id): Pick up an onion from a specific dispenser. Requirement: Hand is empty.
- pickup_dish(dispenser_id): Pick up a dish. Requirement: Hand is empty.
- put_onion_in_pot(pot_id): Put the held onion into a pot. Requirement: Holding onion, Pot is not full.
- fill_dish_with_soup(pot_id): Fill the held dish with soup. Requirement: Holding dish, Soup is ready.
- deliver_soup(serving_id): Deliver soup. Requirement: Holding soup.
- place_obj_on_counter(): Place the held item on a specific counter. Requirement: Hand is not empty

Here are few examples:

Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:4, P1:1], <OnionD 1> [P0:3, P1:2]; <DishD 0> [P0:7, P1:4]; <Serve 0> [P0:2, P1:5]; <Pot 0> [P0:6, P1:3], <Pot 1> [P0:5, P1:4];
Scene 17: <Player 1> holds one onion at (3, 3). <Player 0> holds one onion at (6, 3).
<Player 0> History: Moved: (3, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (6, 3)
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> is empty; <Pot 1> is empty;
Analysis: Both players are holding onions and both pots are empty. Player 0 is moving towards the pots and is slightly closer to Pot 1 (distance 5) than Pot 0. I am also holding an onion and am closer to Pot 0 (distance 3). To work efficiently, Player 0 will likely target Pot 1, so I should fill Pot 0.

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:3, P1:2], <OnionD 1> [P0:2, P1:3]; <DishD 0> [P0:6, P1:5]; <Serve 0> [P0:5, P1:6]; <Pot 0> [P0:5, P1:4], <Pot 1> [P0:4, P1:5];
Scene 3: <Player 1> holds nothing at (2, 2). <Player 0> holds nothing at (5, 2).
<Player 0> History: Moved: (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 2)
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> is empty; <Pot 1> is empty;
Analysis: The game just started and all hands are empty. Player 0 is standing right next to OnionD 1. I am closer to OnionD 0. Player 0 will definitely pick up an onion to start cooking. I should also grab an onion from my nearest dispenser to speed up filling the pots.

Scene 42: <Player 1> holds nothing at (1, 1). <Player 0> holds nothing at (6, 1).
<Player 0> History: Moved: (5, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (6, 1)
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> starts cooking, ready in 15 steps; <Pot 1> has 1 onion;
Analysis: Pot 0 has just started cooking, which means we will soon need a dish to plate the soup. Player 0 is completely empty-handed and is right next to DishD 0, indicating they are going to prepare a dish. Meanwhile, I am near OnionD 0 and should continue supplying onions for Pot 1.

Scene 65: <Player 1> holds one onion at (4, 3). <Player 0> holds one dish at (5, 3).
<Player 0> History: Moved: (6, 1) -> (6, 2) -> (5, 3)
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has already cooked the soup; <Pot 1> has 2 onions;
Analysis: Pot 0 is fully cooked and ready to be served. Player 0 is holding a dish and has navigated directly adjacent to Pot 0. Their clear intention is to fill the dish with the ready soup. I am holding an onion and am right next to Pot 1, which needs one more onion to start cooking.

Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:4, P1:2], <OnionD 1> [P0:5, P1:1]; <DishD 0> [P0:6, P1:5]; <Serve 0> [P0:1, P1:4]; <Pot 0> [P0:3, P1:3], <Pot 1> [P0:4, P1:2];
Scene 88: <Player 1> holds one onion at (2, 3). <Player 0> holds soup at (1, 2).
<Player 0> History: Moved: (3, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2)
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> is empty; <Pot 1> starts cooking, ready in 18 steps;
Analysis: Player 0 has successfully plated the soup and is now immediately next to Serve 0. Delivering the soup is the final step to score 20 points, so Player 0 will definitely deliver it. I am holding an onion and Pot 0 is empty, so I should start placing my onion into Pot 0 to prepare the next meal.

<example>
Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:4, P1:1], <OnionD 1> [P0:3, P1:2]; <DishD 0> [P0:7, P1:4]; <Serve 0> [P0:2, P1:5]; <Pot 0> [P0:6, P1:3], <Pot 1> [P0:5, P1:4];
Scene 55: <Player 0> holds soup at (4, 3). <Player 1> holds one onion at (5, 3).
<Player 0> History: Moved: (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3)
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> is empty; <Pot 1> is empty;
Analysis: Player 0 has successfully plated the soup and is heading to Serve 0, which is the highest priority. I am carrying an onion in the opposite direction towards the pots. Because the center of the counter circuit is blocked and the path is a narrow loop, we are currently facing each other and blocking the way. I must yield and wait to let Player 0 pass safely to avoid a deadlock.

Suppose you are an assistant who is proficient in the overcooked_ai game. Your goal is to control *Player 0* and cooperate with Player 1 who is real person.
- For each step, you will receive the current scene information.
- Based on the information, you need to 
    1. Describe the current scene and analysis it,
    2. Infer what Player 1 will do, 
    3. Plan ONLY ONE best skill for Player 0 to do right now based on infered player 1's intention. Format should not use natural language, but use the allowed functions.

Instructions:
- The Overcooked_AI game requires two players to work together as a team with the goal of achieving the highest possible score.
- Interaction Constraint (CRITICAL):
    - Player 1 operates on the Left side and can ONLY interact with: <OnionD 0>, <DishD 0>, <Pot 0>, <Pot 1>, <Serve 0>.
    - Player 0 operates on the Right side and can ONLY interact with: <OnionD 1>, <DishD 1>, <Pot 0>, <Pot 1>, <Serve 1>.
- To get the points, the team need to make soup according to recipe, fill the soup in a dish and immediately deliver the soup to the service loc. Once a delivery is made, the team gets 20 points. Plus, this soup and dishes will disappear, no need to wash and recycle the dishes.
- To make a soup, the team must pick up **three onions** one by one, put them in a pot. The pot will automatically start cooking when the pot is full (contains 3 onions) and it will take 20 time steps to complete the soup.
- Items (onions and dishes) can be obtained from dispensers, which have an unlimited supply. However, each player can only pick up and hold one item at a time.
- The pot is a stationary unit that cannot be moved, and can ONLY hold three onions.
- After start cooking, the pot needs certain cooking timesteps to finish a food. Before the food is finished, players can choose to:
    - Pick up the dish and wait.
    - Prepare for another cook cycle (especially if there is more than one pot in the environment).
- Once a onions is picked up, it can only be held by the player, placed in the pot (unless the pot is full), or placed on a counter. Similarly, once a dish is picked up, it can either be held by the player, filled with soup, or placed on a counter.
- One counter can place Only one item.
- Inventory Constraint: If a player holds an item (onion or dish), they CANNOT pickup another item. They MUST put_onion_in_pot, fill_dish_with_soup, or place_obj_on_counter first.

Skill: 
In this game, each player can ONLY perform the following 6 allowed skill: pickup_onion, pickup_dish, put_onion_in_pot, fill_dish_with_soup, deliver_soup, place_obj_on_counter, wait. Do not attempt to use any other skills that are not listed here.
- pickup_onion(dispenser_id): Pick up an onion from a specific dispenser. Requirement: Hand is empty.
- pickup_dish(dispenser_id): Pick up a dish. Requirement: Hand is empty.
- put_onion_in_pot(pot_id): Put the held onion into a pot. Requirement: Holding onion, Pot is not full.
- fill_dish_with_soup(pot_id): Fill the held dish with soup. Requirement: Holding dish, Soup is ready.
- deliver_soup(serving_id): Deliver soup. Requirement: Holding soup.
- place_obj_on_counter(): Place the held item on a specific counter. Requirement: Hand is not empty

Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:6, P1:1], <OnionD 1> [P0:1, P1:4]; <DishD 0> [P0:4, P1:5], <DishD 1> [P0:2, P1:7]; <Pot 0> [P0:1, P1:4], <Pot 1> [P0:2, P1:5]; <Serve 0> [P0:5, P1:2], <Serve 1> [P0:2, P1:5]; Scene 0: <Player 0> holds nothing at (5, 2). <Player 1> holds nothing at (1, 1). <Player 1> History: Moved: Start -> (1, 1). Kitchen states: <Pot 0> is empty. <Pot 1> is empty.
Analysis: Both pots are empty. Player 1 is closest to OnionD 0 (dist 1). Player 0 is closest to OnionD 1 (dist 1). We should each use our nearest dispenser to be efficient.

Layout: <OnionD 0> [P0:6, P1:2], <OnionD 1> [P0:1, P1:5]; <DishD 0> [P0:4, P1:6], <DishD 1> [P0:2, P1:8]; <Pot 0> [P0:1, P1:3], <Pot 1> [P0:2, P1:4]; <Serve 0> [P0:5, P1:2], <Serve 1> [P0:2, P1:5]; Scene 81: <Player 0> holds nothing at (5, 2). <Player 1> holds nothing at (1, 2). <Player 1> History: Moved: (3, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has 2 onions. <Pot 1> is empty.
Analysis: Pot 0 needs 1 more onion. Player 1 is moving to OnionD 0 (dist 2) and will likely pick up the last onion. Player 0 is near DishD 1 (dist 2) and should prepare a dish for the next phase.

Analysis: Pot 1 needs more onions. Both players hold onions. Since both are close to the pots, we should both put onions in Pot 1 to fill it quickly.

Analysis: Pot 0 is ready. Player 1 holds an onion but is blocked because Pot 0 is full. Player 0 holds a dish. Player 0 must fill the dish with soup to empty Pot 0 so Player 1 can place their onion.

Kitchen states: <Pot 0> is empty. <Pot 1> makes a soup and soup needs to be filled in a dish.
Analysis: Pot 1 is ready. Player 1 is much closer to DishD 0 (dist 1) than I am to any dish. Player 1 will get the dish. I should prepare onions for the empty Pot 0.

Kitchen states: <Pot 0> starts cooking, the soup will be ready after 13 timesteps;  <Pot 1> has already cooked the soup.
Analysis: Pot 1 is ready. Player 1 holds a dish and is right next to Pot 1 (dist 1), so they will serve. Player 0 holds an onion but has no empty pot. Player 0 should wait.

Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has already cooked the soup. <Pot 1> starts cooking, ready in 15 steps.
Analysis: Pot 0 is ready. Pot 1 is busy. Both players hold onions. Pot 0 is full with cooked soup and Pot 1 is cooking, so onions cannot be placed. One player must free inventory to enable serving.

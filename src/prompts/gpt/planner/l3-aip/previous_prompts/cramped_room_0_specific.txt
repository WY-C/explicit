Suppose you are an assistant who is proficient in the overcooked_ai game. Your goal is to control Player 0 and cooperate with Player 1 who is controlled by a certain strategy in order to get a high score.
- Player 0 and Player 1 cannot communicate. 
- For each step, you will receive the current scene (including the kitchen, teammates status, partner's 3 step position history).
- Based on the current scene, you need to 
    1. Describe the current scene and analysis it,
    2. Infer what Player 1 will do, 
    3. Plan ONLY ONE best skill for Player 0 to do right now based on infered player 1's intention. Format should not use natural language, but use the allowed functions.

Instructions:
- The Overcooked_AI game requires two players to work together as a team with the goal of achieving the highest possible score.
- To get the points, the team need to make soup according to recipe, fill the soup in a dish and immediately deliver the soup to the service loc. Once a delivery is made, the team gets 20 points. Plus, this soup and dishes will disappear, no need to wash and recycle the dishes.
- To make a soup, the team must pick up **three ingredients** one by one, put them in a pot. The pot will automatically start cooking when the pot is full (contains 3 ingredients) and it will take 20 time steps to complete the soup.
- Items (ingredients and dishes) can be obtained from dispensers, which have an unlimited supply. However, each player can only pick up and hold one item at a time.
- The pot is a stationary unit that cannot be moved, and can ONLY hold three ingredients.
- After start cooking, the pot needs needs certain cooking timesteps to finish a food. Before the food is finished, players can choose to:
    - wait (probably not efficient)
    - Pick up the dish and wait to fill soup in the dish.
    - Prepare for another cook cycle (especially if there is more than one pot in the environment).
- Once a ingredient is picked up, it can only be held by the player, placed in the pot (unless the pot is full), or placed on a counter. Similarly, once a dish is picked up, it can either be held by the player, filled with soup, or placed on a counter.
- One counter can place Only one item.

Skill: 
In this game, each player can ONLY perform the following 6 allowed skill: pickup, place_obj_on_counter, put_onion_in_pot, fill_dish_with_soup, deliver_soup, wait. Do not attempt to use any other skills that are not listed here.
def pickup_onion(onion_dispensers_index):
    if object_in_hand() == "nothing": # hand holds nothing
        if obj in ["onion"]:
            pass
def pickup_dish(dish_dispensers_index):
    if object_in_hand() == "nothing": # hand holds nothing
        if obj in ["dish"]:
            pass
def put_onion_in_pot(pots_index): # put one onion
    if object_in_hand() == "onion":
        if pot_onions_count() < 3:
            pass
def fill_dish_with_soup(Pots's index):
    if object_in_hand() == "dish":
        if soup_ready() or pot_started_cooking():
        #soup_ready말고 pot_started_cooking만 두면 더 잘 할 거 같음.
        # It is enough for one condition to be true
            pass
def deliver_soup():
    if object_in_hand("soup"):
        pass
def place_obj_on_counter(obj):
    if object_in_hand() == "obj":
        pass
def wait(): 
    # Stay in the current position for 1 timestep. 
    # Use this if blocked or waiting for the partner to pass.
    pass

H: Layout Information: Onion Dispensers: [(0, 1), (4, 1)]; Dish Dispensers: [(1, 3)]; Serving Locations: [(3, 3)]; Pots: [(2, 0)].
Scene 0: <Player 0> holds nothing at (1, 1). <Player 1> holds nothing at (3, 1).
<Player 1> History: Moved: Start -> (3, 1).
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> is empty.
A: Analysis: Pot 0 is empty. Both players need to pick up onions. Player 1 is near the right onion dispenser (Index 1). Player 0 is near the left onion dispenser (Index 0).
Intention for Player 1: "pickup_onion(1)"
Plan for Player 0: "pickup_onion(0)"

<Player 1> History: Moved: (3, 2) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 1) (Stayed/Blocked).
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has 2 onions.
A: Analysis: Pot 0 needs 1 more onion. Player 1 is at the right onion dispenser (Index 1) and will likely pick up the last onion. Player 0 is near the dish dispenser (Index 0) and should prepare a dish for the next phase.
Intention for Player 1: "pickup_onion(1)"
Plan for Player 0: "pickup_dish(0)"

<Player 1> History: Moved: (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 1).
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has 1 onion and needs more. 
A: Analysis: The pot has one onion and needs two more. Both players are holding onions. Player 1 is at (2, 1), which is directly in front of the pot at (2, 0). They are likely putting the onion in. Player 0 is also close and should put their onion in as well.
Intention for Player 1: "put_onion_in_pot(0)".

<Player 1> History: Moved: (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1).
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has 2 onions and needs one more. 
A: Analysis: The pot has two onions and needs one more. Player 1 is holding an onion and is standing at (2, 1), right in front of the pot. They will put it in to start cooking. Player 0 is near the dish dispenser at (1, 3) and should pick up a dish to wait for the soup.

<Player 1> History: Moved: (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 1) (Stayed/Blocked).
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has already cooked the soup.
A: Analysis: The pot has soup ready. Player 1 holds an onion and is standing at (2, 1) (the interaction spot for the pot), but cannot use it because the pot is full. Player 0 holds a dish. Player 0 must fill the dish with soup to empty the pot so Player 1 can place their onion.
Intention for Player 1: "wait()". 
Plan for Player 0: "fill_dish_with_soup(0)".

<Player 1> History: Moved: (3, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 2).
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> makes a soup and soup needs to be filled in a dish.
A: Analysis: The pot has cooked soup. Both players hold nothing. Player 1 is closer to the serving area/dish dispenser side but currently empty-handed. We need a dish and an onion for the next cycle. I will pick up the dish since I am closer to the dish dispenser at (1, 3).
Intention for Player 1: "pickup_onion(1)".
Plan for Player 0: "pickup_dish(0)".

<Player 1> History: Moved: (1, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 1).
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> starts cooking, the soup will be ready in 19 timesteps.
A: Analysis: The pot has just started cooking. Player 1 is holding a dish and is positioned at (2, 1) near the pot, ready to catch the soup or wait. Since Player 1 has the dish, Player 0 should prepare for the *next* cooking cycle by grabbing an onion.

Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has 1 onion and needs more.

<Player 1> History: Moved: (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 1).
Kitchen states: <Pot 0> has 1 onion and needs more.
A: Analysis: The pot needs onions, not a dish yet. Player 0 holds a dish which is useless right now and blocks interaction. Player 1 is at the pot with an onion. Player 0 must drop the dish on a counter (e.g., at (0, 2)) to get an onion.
